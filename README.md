# Data_Visualization-challenge
Module 5 Assignment Submission

I have referred to the pandas documentation for the function to find duplicated records in a dataframe
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.duplicated.html

All the other syntax used in the assignment were covered and introduced in the data visualization sessions.

Files and folders included
Pymaceuticals folder containing-
Pymaceuticals_starter (jupyter notebook) 
data (folder containing Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv)

I have worked independently on this assignment.
